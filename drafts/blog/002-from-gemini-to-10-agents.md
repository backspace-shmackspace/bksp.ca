HOOK:
Eight weeks ago, I typed a risk assessment question into Gemini and got back a response that classified routine technical debt as a critical systemic failure. Today I run a pipeline of 10 specialized AI agents with 1,189 tests, 90% coverage, and a red team that argues with its own findings until they're defensible. Here's every failure that got me from there to here.

ARC:
Tell the story as a six-phase evolution, each phase triggered by a specific failure in the previous one.

Phase I: vanilla Gemini produces risk amplification bias — LLMs without encoded risk appetite miscategorize everything as critical.

Phase II: build a custom model layer with RAG, authority hierarchies, and weighted data tiers — hit the knowledge base ceiling, discover instruction drift where advisory data overrides governance protocols, encounter "silent context loss" where the model fakes knowledge after context window saturation.

Phase III: transition to Claude Code and agentic architecture — use AI to decompose the monolithic system into modular agents (the recursive development model).

Phase IV: production integration with JIRA middleware.

Phase V: workspace isolation, stateful execution, adversarial red teaming.

Phase VI: the current system with convergence scoring, compliance mapping, and self-improving agents.

The through-line: each phase exists because the previous one broke in a specific, instructive way. The "learn by doing" philosophy applied to AI system design.

The key insight at the end: the most effective enterprise AI implementation is not the automation of results, but the automation of the auditing process.

KEY DATA POINTS:
- Phase I: zero-shot prompting → risk amplification bias (routine debt classified as critical)
- Phase II: 8-file knowledge base limit → instruction drift, advisory overriding governance
- Phase II: context window saturation → "silent context loss" (model outputs high-confidence responses about context it has already purged)
- Phase II: 3-tier authority weighting (Governance 1.0, JIRA 0.7, User Input 0.3)
- Phase III: monolithic → modular decomposition → ~40% reduction in hallucination rates
- Phase III → today: 10 specialized agents, 1,189 tests, 90% coverage
- Performance: 27% speed improvement through graph logic changes alone
- Variance: 84% → 15-20% through differentiated temperature tuning
- Timeline: ~8 weeks from first Gemini prompt to production multi-agent pipeline

SENSITIVITY FLAGS:
- Must not name "Project Solomon" as it's an internal project name — use "a custom model layer" or "a RAG-based system"
- Must not reference JIRA by name in the context of employer workflows — use "issue tracker" or "system of record"
- Must not name the employer, team, or specific risk domain
- Google Forms → JIRA integration details are too specific — generalize to "automated intake pipeline"
- Gemini and Claude can be named (they're public products Ian used personally)
- The technical patterns (authority weighting, context saturation, modular decomposition) are generic and safe
- "Silent context loss" is a universal LLM phenomenon — safe to discuss
