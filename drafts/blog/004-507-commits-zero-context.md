## Writing Guidance

### Hook
My MacBook died. No Time Machine backup, no cloned drive, no local journal. Eight weeks of work on a multi-agent risk assessment pipeline — gone. Except it wasn't. Every commit was in GitLab. In three hours, I had full project context back.

### Arc
Open with the catastrophic failure: hardware death, local data loss, no journal, no analysis sessions, no tribal knowledge. The instinct is panic or resignation. Instead: systematic recovery. Walk through the 5-step process: (1) clone all repositories (18 repos, 507 commits recovered), (2) extract commit timelines (1,002-line chronological history), (3) thematic analysis (group repos by domain, extract patterns from commit messages), (4) memory-jogging via targeted questions (what drove this decision? why this architecture?), (5) documentation synthesis (work outline, memory capture, forward-looking journal system). Highlight the key insight: git history isn't just version control, it's organizational memory. Commit messages tell the story of evolution. Phase history documents show learning. The codebase itself survives with CLAUDE.md, README, and technical documentation. Close with the transferable principle: git is your safety net, commit messages matter, documentation in repo survives with code, and systematic recovery beats random exploration.

### Key Data Points
- Catastrophic failure: MacBook death, zero local backups
- Recovery scope: 18 repositories, 507 commits, 8 weeks of work
- Recovery time: 3 hours from git clone to full project context
- Artifacts generated: 1,002-line timeline, work outline, memory capture, journal system spec
- Key discovery: archetype infrastructure already merged to main (Feb 7) — would have been lost knowledge without git forensics
- Strategic vision recovered: security data federation, OpenShift AI migration (both undocumented locally)
- Forward-looking fix: Obsidian vault + Git auto-commit (30 min) + daily push (cron job)

### Source Material
- `~/journal/daily/2026-02-22.md` — Full recovery session (Session 1-4)
- `~/journal/learnings/project-recovery-strategy.md` — Complete recovery playbook
- `~/projects/WORK_OUTLINE.md` — Thematic analysis output
- `~/projects/MEMORY_CAPTURE.md` — Memory-jogging Q&A output

### Sensitivity Flags
- Must not name employer, team members, or specific project names (use "a multi-agent risk assessment pipeline")
- Must not reference specific internal systems (JIRA, GitLab instance names, compliance frameworks)
- Git workflows, commit analysis, and documentation patterns are generic — safe to discuss
- Obsidian and GitLab are public tools — safe to mention
- The 507 commits, 18 repos, 8 weeks numbers are personal work metrics — safe to use
