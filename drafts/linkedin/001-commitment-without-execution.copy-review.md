# Editorial Review: LinkedIn Post #1 — Risk Register Dysfunction

## VERDICT: PUBLISH

This is a strong piece. It has a quotable hook, a clear structural rhythm, a specific insight, and stakes a defensible position. Minor polish only.

---

### Hook Assessment

**Opening line:** "A commitment without a resource allocation is just a neglected meeting outcome."

This is a strong hook. It's aphoristic, immediately quotable, and sets up tension without explaining itself. The reader has to lean in to understand why this matters. It avoids the classic LinkedIn failure modes:
- Not credential-leading ("After 20 years...")
- Not throat-clearing ("Risk management is...")
- Not seeking agreement ("We all know that...")

**Minor note:** The hook is abstract enough that it might not instantly grab someone scrolling fast. The second paragraph pays off the hook quickly ("critical-severity tickets...cycling for over a year"), which rescues it. The hook + paragraph 2 combo works well together.

**Score:** 8.5/10. Strong, but not immediately visceral. Consider testing a version that leads with the concrete detail: "I found critical-severity tickets that had been cycling through the same pattern for over a year. A commitment without a resource allocation is just a neglected meeting outcome."

### Structural Issues

**Paragraph 1 (Hook):** Does its job. Sets up the thesis without explaining it.

**Paragraph 2 (Concrete example):** This is where the piece earns the reader's attention. The contrast between "engineering bug → escalated → fixed" vs. "risk ticket → cycles for 1-2 years" is sharp and effective. Good pacing.

**Paragraph 3 (The cycle breakdown):** The numbered list works. It's not padding—each step is specific and recognizable. The list format gives the reader a mental model to test against their own experience. The rhythm accelerates here, which is good.

**Paragraph 4 (The reframe):** "No one is lying. No one is negligent." This is a critical move. You're defusing defensiveness before it starts. Smart.

**Paragraph 5 (The insight):** This is the core of the piece. "The gap is comfort. A risk on a register feels managed." This is the single most quotable line in the piece. The rest of the paragraph unpacks it well—each sentence builds on the last without repeating.

**Paragraph 6 (The challenge):** "Open your risk register. Find your oldest critical-severity ticket." This is a strong closer. It's specific, actionable, and slightly confrontational without being hostile. The reader can do this in 60 seconds. That's good engagement design.

**Paragraph 7 (The punch):** "You don't have a risk management problem. You have an engineering management problem that nobody's treating like one." Strong. Provocative. Stakes a clear position. This will drive comments.

**Pacing:** The piece accelerates. It starts abstract, gets concrete, gives a framework, delivers the insight, then challenges the reader. No sag. Every paragraph earns its place.

### The "So What"

**What the reader walks away with:**
1. A new mental model for why risk registers fail (comfort, not discipline)
2. A specific diagnostic they can run today (check oldest critical ticket)
3. A reframe: this is an engineering management problem, not a risk problem

**Is the insight novel?** Yes. Most risk management content says "communicate better" or "get executive buy-in." This piece says the problem is structural—the register itself creates the illusion of progress. That's a genuine reframe.

**Would the target reader forward this?** Yes. A CISO or risk manager who's felt this frustration would share this. It names something that's been implicit.

**The "conference slide test":** Could someone screenshot a line from this and use it in a presentation? Absolutely. "The register doesn't just fail to solve the problem. It makes not solving it feel acceptable." That's a slide.

---

### Engagement Potential

**Does the piece invite response?**

Yes. The final line is inherently debate-starting: "You don't have a risk management problem. You have an engineering management problem."

Someone will push back on this. Someone will say "but we don't have engineering resources to assign." That's good—you want that comment. It proves the point.

**Call to action:**

The CTA is embedded: "Open your risk register. Find your oldest critical-severity ticket. Count how many times it's been through this loop."

This is specific and actionable. Better than "What do you think?" Readers who do this exercise will want to comment with their results or their own war stories.

**Closing line:**

"If the answer is more than twice, you don't have a risk management problem. You have an engineering management problem that nobody's treating like one."

This lands hard. It's provocative without being inflammatory. It reframes the problem clearly. Strong closer.

**Predicted engagement:** High. This will drive comments from:
- People who agree and have their own stories
- People who push back on the "engineering management" framing
- People who want to share their own solutions

### Voice Alignment

**Evidence-first?** Yes. The piece leads with a concrete observation (critical tickets cycling for 1-2 years), not a theory.

**Directly decisive?** Yes. The final line commits fully: "You have an engineering management problem." No hedging.

**Quietly contrarian?** Yes. The piece challenges the premise that risk registers are doing their job. It doesn't scream "you're all wrong"—it says "the system is wrong."

**The influencer test:** Read this in the voice of someone who posts "I'm humbled to announce..." Does it fit? No. The piece is too specific, too concrete, too willing to name a real problem. It doesn't feel like engagement farming.

**Does it sound like Ian?** Yes. This sounds like an engineer who walked into a risk management org and thought "this is broken, and here's why." The tone is analytical, not emotional. The insight is structural, not personal. That's on-brand.

### Top 3 Issues (Ranked by Impact)

1. **Hook could be more visceral (minor):** The opening line is strong, but it's abstract. Consider leading with the concrete detail ("critical-severity tickets cycling for 1-2 years") to hook faster, then pivot to the aphorism. Test both versions.

2. **"Partial action" step could be more specific (very minor):** In the 4-step cycle, "some work happens, usually manual, usually temporary" is the weakest description. Consider adding one more concrete detail: "some work happens—usually manual, usually a workaround, usually temporary."

3. **The phrase "neglected meeting outcome" is slightly awkward (very minor):** "Neglected meeting outcome" reads a bit stiff. Consider alternatives: "a neglected action item" / "a calendar entry that expires" / "a to-do list that gets archived." But honestly, the current phrasing works—it's just not as punchy as the rest of the piece.

### Specific Rewrites

**Option 1: Hook reordering (test this version)**

Current:
> A commitment without a resource allocation is just a neglected meeting outcome.
>
> In engineering, a critical production bug that sits unresolved for months gets escalated...

Alternative:
> In engineering, a critical production bug that sits unresolved for months gets escalated, gets people reassigned, gets fixed. In risk management, I found critical-severity tickets that had been cycling through the same pattern for over a year—sometimes approaching two—with no sustained remediation.
>
> A commitment without a resource allocation is just a neglected meeting outcome.

This version leads with the concrete contrast, then delivers the aphorism as a thesis. It might hook faster. Test both.

**Option 2: Strengthen "partial action" step**

Current:
> 2. **Partial action** — some work happens, usually manual, usually temporary

Suggested:
> 2. **Partial action** — some work happens, usually manual, usually a workaround, usually temporary

Adds one word. Makes it more concrete.

**Option 3: Punch up the hook (if you want it sharper)**

Current:
> A commitment without a resource allocation is just a neglected meeting outcome.

Alternative:
> A commitment without a resource allocation is just a calendar event that expires.

Shorter. Sharper. More visual. But the current version works fine.

## Final Assessment

This is a publishable piece. It has a clear insight, a specific challenge, and a provocative thesis. It will drive engagement. The voice is clean, the pacing is tight, and the structure works.

The only question is whether you want to lead with the concrete detail or the aphorism. Test both. My instinct is the current version (aphorism first) is riskier but more distinctive. The alternative (concrete first) is safer and will hook more readers.

Either way: **this is ready to ship.**
