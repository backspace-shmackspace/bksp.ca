| **Sensitivity** | CLEAR | ✅ Fully anonymized |

## Editorial Verdict: REVISE

**Strengths:**
- Strong hook: Engineering discipline (close unreproducible bugs) vs. risk management dysfunction
- Bold, quotable framework: "Quantify or kill. Two weeks."
- Excellent closer: "Your register should be short, sharp, and fully resourced. Not long, vague, and ignored."
- Names the objection explicitly: "But what if we close it and something happens?"
- Voice is evidence-first, directly decisive, and quietly contrarian (on-brand)

**Critical fixes required (2 em-dashes):**
1. Line 23: "Not 'this could be bad' — but specific data." → "Not 'this could be bad.' Specific data."
2. Line 33: "The risks you're neglecting because your register is full of noise — those are the ones that will bite you." → "The risks you're neglecting because your register is full of noise? Those are the ones that will bite you."

**Optional polish:**
- Tighten "Quantify" paragraph (line 23-25) - currently 6 sentences, meanders through rhetorical questions. Suggest reducing to 4 sentences.
- Delete "Here's how it works:" transition line (line 21) - unnecessary, formatting makes structure clear.

**Engagement prediction:** Very high. Will drive debate from people who love the clarity, people who think "kill" is too aggressive, and people who want to know how to enforce the two-week rule.

## Visual Readiness: N/A (Text Post Recommended)

**Recommendation:** Post as plain text without attached media.

**Rationale:**
- LinkedIn's algorithm favors native text posts
- The framework is quotable without a visual
- Adding media would likely reduce reach

**Optional (post-publish amplification):**
- If post gets 100+ reactions, create quote card: "Quantify or kill. Two weeks." or "Your register should be short, sharp, and fully resourced."

**Visual opportunities identified:** 3 (quote card, framework diagram, before/after comparison)
**Visual opportunities recommended:** 0 (text post performs better standalone)

## Sensitivity Verdict: CLEAR

**Findings:**
- ✅ No named entities (people, companies, products, projects)
- ✅ No identifiable employer references
- ✅ No specific timeframes or organizational details that create fingerprinting risk
- ✅ Framed as personal methodology ("I brought a rule with me"), not employer policy
- ✅ "Inherited risk registers" = career-spanning, not current-role reporting
- ✅ "Career risk managers" = role descriptor, not individual critique

**Fingerprint risk:** None. The "quantify or kill" methodology is presented as Ian's personal framework, not Red Hat or IBM IP.

**Employer risk:** None. The post doesn't identify Red Hat, doesn't describe a specific security gap, and doesn't attribute the problem to any organization.

**Career risk:** None. No NDA violations, no proprietary disclosures, no disparagement.

**⚠️ Important:** Delete the draft metadata section (lines 39-66) before posting. It contains internal references (JIRA tickets, colleague names) that should NOT be published. The post content itself (lines 11-36) is clean.

## Top 3 Editorial Issues (Ranked by Impact)

1. **Style violations: 2 em-dashes (CRITICAL)** - Must be fixed before publishing. Lines 23 and 33. Replace with periods or question marks.

2. **"Quantify" paragraph sags (moderate)** - Paragraph 5 is too long (6 sentences) and loses momentum. Rhetorical questions feel repetitive. Tighten to 3-4 sentences for better pacing.

3. **Unnecessary transition line (minor)** - "Here's how it works:" can be deleted. Go straight from "Quantify or kill. Two weeks." to the definitions.

---

## Top 3 Visual Opportunities (Ranked by Impact)

1. **Quote card graphic (optional, post-publish)** - If post performs well, create shareable quote card for Twitter/Instagram with "Quantify or kill. Two weeks." or "Your register should be short, sharp, and fully resourced."

2. **None recommended for initial post** - Text posts perform better without media on LinkedIn.

3. **Framework diagram (skip)** - Not needed for this format. Better saved for blog post expansion.

## Top Sensitivity Risks

**None identified.** This post is a model for anonymization.

**⚠️ Action required:** Delete draft metadata (lines 39-66) before posting. Internal references (JIRA keys, colleague names) are fine for personal notes but should not be published.

---

## Overall Recommendation

**Fix the 2 em-dashes and ship.**

This is a strong follow-up to Post #1. The framework is concrete, actionable, and quotable. The closer lands hard. The objection is named explicitly, which will drive debate.

**Required before posting:**
1. ✅ Fix 2 em-dashes (lines 23 and 33)
2. ✅ Delete draft metadata section (lines 39-66)

**Optional polish:**
3. ⚪ Tighten "Quantify" paragraph (line 23-25)
4. ⚪ Delete "Here's how it works:" transition (line 21)

**Posting strategy:**
1. Post as plain text (no attached media, no links)
2. Post 3-5 days after Post #1 (allow Post #1 to breathe)
3. Add first comment referencing Post #1: "This pairs with my previous post on the Commitment-Without-Execution Loop. Risks that can't be quantified are the ones most likely to cycle through that pattern indefinitely."
4. Monitor comments and engage with debate (people will push back on "kill")

---

**Final score:** 8.5/10 (would be 9/10 with em-dash fixes)

This will perform as well or better than Post #1. The "quantify or kill" framework is immediately usable. Ship it after fixing the em-dashes.
