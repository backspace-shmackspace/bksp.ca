# Visual Design Review: LinkedIn Post #2 - Quantify or Kill

**Post Type:** LinkedIn text post
**Visual Budget:** 1-2 optional visuals (LinkedIn text posts work best standalone)

---

## Visual Opportunities

LinkedIn text posts typically perform best without attached images (LinkedIn's algorithm favors native text). However, if you want to amplify reach or create a companion visual for cross-posting, here are the opportunities:

---

### Option 1: Quote Card (Optional)

**Type:** Text-based social media card
**Purpose:** Shareable asset for Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn carousel

**Text options (choose one):**
1. "Quantify or kill. Two weeks."
2. "Your register should be short, sharp, and fully resourced. Not long, vague, and ignored."
3. "A risk register isn't a collection of everything that might go wrong. It's a prioritized queue of quantified threats with owners and deadlines."

**Visual approach:**
- **Background:** Dark (#0a0f1a matching bksp.ca)
- **Text:** Large, bold, high-contrast (white on dark or blue accent)
- **Branding:** "bksp.ca" in corner
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1080px (square) or 1200x630px (landscape)

**Suggested tool:** Canva or Figma

**Note:** This is OPTIONAL. LinkedIn text posts often perform better without media. Use only if testing engagement or cross-posting to other platforms.

### Option 2: Framework Diagram (Not Recommended for LinkedIn Post)

**Type:** Decision tree / flow chart
**Concept:** Visualize the "Quantify or kill. Two weeks." framework

**What to show:**
- Start: New risk identified
- Branch 1: Can you quantify? (Yes → Assign owner, track like incident)
- Branch 2: Can't quantify after 2 weeks? (No → Close ticket)

**Why NOT recommended:**
- The framework is simple enough that a diagram adds complexity, not clarity
- Text version is more quotable
- Better saved for a blog post expansion

---

### Option 3: Before/After Comparison (Not Recommended)

**Type:** Side-by-side comparison table
**Concept:** "Typical Risk Register" vs. "Quantify or Kill Register"

**Columns:**
- Left: "Long, vague, and ignored" (100+ tickets, no owners, vague severity)
- Right: "Short, sharp, and fully resourced" (15 tickets, all with owners, quantified impact)

**Why NOT recommended:**
- Requires hypothetical data (no real metrics provided in post)
- Could feel preachy
- Text version is stronger

## Social Media Card (For Future Use)

If this post becomes a blog post or longer article later:

**Concept:** Simple text-based card with the framework as headline
**Key text overlay:** "Quantify or kill. Two weeks."
**Subtext:** "A risk register should be short, sharp, and fully resourced."
**Visual element:** Minimal background, high-contrast text
**Dimensions:** 1200x630px (Open Graph standard)
**Branding:** "bksp.ca" in footer

---

## Recommendation

**For initial LinkedIn post: No visual.**

LinkedIn's algorithm favors native text posts without links or attached media. Your post is strong enough to stand alone. Adding a visual would likely reduce reach.

**For amplification (later):**
- If the post performs well (100+ reactions), create a quote card and post separately a few days later
- If cross-posting to Twitter/Instagram, use quote card there

**Visual readiness verdict:** N/A (text post, no visual required)

---

## Implementation Priority

1. **Do first:** Post as plain text (no visual)
2. **Optional (post-publish):** Create quote card if post gets 100+ reactions
3. **Skip:** Diagram and comparison table (not needed for this format)

---

**Bottom line:** Ship this as a text post. No visual needed.
