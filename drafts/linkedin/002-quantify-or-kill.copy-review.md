# Editorial Review: LinkedIn Post #2 - Quantify or Kill

## VERDICT: REVISE

Strong core concept and good structural rhythm, but multiple style violations and some hedging that weakens the punch. Fixable with targeted edits.

---

### Style Violations (CRITICAL)

**Em-dash count:** 2

1. **Line 23:** "Not 'this could be bad' — but specific data."
   - **Fix:** "Not 'this could be bad.' Specific data."

2. **Line 33:** "The risks you're neglecting because your register is full of noise — those are the ones that will bite you."
   - **Fix:** "The risks you're neglecting because your register is full of noise? Those are the ones that will bite you."

**Banned phrases found:** None

**Other violations:**
- **Line 24:** "some work happens, usually manual, usually temporary" - slight hedging with "usually" (appears twice). Consider: "Gather concrete evidence. Not 'this could be bad.' Specific data."

---

### Hook Assessment

**Opening line:** "In software engineering, if a bug can't be reproduced, you close it. You don't carry an unreproducible bug on your backlog for two years 'just in case.'"

**Strength:** This is a strong hook. It sets up a clear contrast (engineering discipline vs. risk management), uses concrete detail (two years, unreproducible bug), and creates immediate tension. The "just in case" in quotes is a nice touch that signals the absurdity.

**Minor note:** The second sentence is technically redundant (it restates the first), but it works here because the repetition reinforces the ridiculousness of carrying dead weight.

**Score:** 8.5/10. Strong contrast, concrete, creates tension. Could be slightly punchier by cutting "You don't" and going straight to: "If a bug can't be reproduced, close it. Don't carry an unreproducible bug on your backlog for two years 'just in case.'"

### Structural Issues

**Paragraph 1 (Hook):** Strong. Engineering vs. risk management contrast is clear.

**Paragraph 2 (The problem):** This paragraph does the work. "I've inherited risk registers where critical-severity tickets had been open for over a year with no concrete evidence of impact, no quantified exposure, and no definition of what 'mitigated' would even look like." This is specific, damning, and credible. Good pacing.

**Paragraph 3 (The rule):** "Quantify or kill. Two weeks." This is the money line. It's bold, simple, and quotable. The formatting (bold) helps it land. Strong.

**Paragraph 4 (Here's how it works intro):** Unnecessary. The piece would be stronger without this transition line. Go straight from "Quantify or kill. Two weeks." to the two definitions.

**Paragraph 5 (Quantify definition):** This paragraph sags. It's too long (6 sentences) and loses momentum. The core idea is solid, but the execution is meandering. The sentence structure gets repetitive ("How many systems... What's the actual exposure... Can you show three real examples?"). Consider tightening to 3-4 sentences max.

**Paragraph 6 (Kill definition):** Much tighter. "If two weeks of focused evidence gathering doesn't yield actionable scope, close the ticket. Not 'defer.' Not 'move to monitoring.' Close it." This rhythm works. The "Not X. Not Y. Z." structure is punchy.

**Paragraph 7 (Why two weeks):** Good. This answers the obvious question (why two weeks specifically?) with a clear rationale. The line "Every minute spent discussing a risk nobody can quantify is a minute not spent on the three risks you CAN quantify and ARE actively being exploited" is strong.

**Paragraph 8 (Pushback):** "The pushback I get from career risk managers: 'But what if we close it and something happens?'" This is good. It names the objection clearly and sets up the counterargument.

**Paragraph 9 (Answer):** "What's happening RIGHT NOW while this vaguely-defined ticket consumes meeting time and mental bandwidth? The risks you're neglecting because your register is full of noise [em-dash violation] those are the ones that will bite you." Strong closer for this section, but the em-dash weakens it. Fix the punctuation.

**Paragraph 10 (Reframe):** "A risk register isn't a collection of everything that might go wrong. It's a prioritized queue of quantified threats with owners and deadlines. Anything that can't meet that standard is noise." This is excellent. Clear reframe. Good contrast.

**Paragraph 11 (Final punch):** "Your register should be short, sharp, and fully resourced. Not long, vague, and ignored." Perfect closer. The parallel structure (short/sharp/resourced vs. long/vague/ignored) lands hard. This is the line people will screenshot.

### The "So What"

**What the reader walks away with:**
1. A specific, actionable framework: Quantify or kill. Two weeks.
2. A clear definition of what "quantify" and "kill" mean in practice
3. A reframe: risk registers should be short, sharp, and fully resourced

**Is the insight novel?** Yes. Most risk management content says "prioritize better" or "focus on what matters." This piece gives a specific, time-bound rule and permission to close tickets. That's genuinely actionable.

**Would the target reader forward this?** Absolutely. A risk manager stuck with a bloated register will share this. A CISO frustrated with vague risks will share this. The "quantify or kill" framework is immediately usable.

**The "conference slide test":** "Your register should be short, sharp, and fully resourced. Not long, vague, and ignored." That's a slide. So is "Quantify or kill. Two weeks."

---

### Engagement Potential

**Does the piece invite response?**

Yes. The line "The pushback I get from career risk managers: 'But what if we close it and something happens?'" explicitly names the objection. People will comment to either:
- Agree and share their own bloated register horror stories
- Push back on the "two weeks" timeline as too aggressive
- Debate whether "kill" is too harsh (some will argue for "defer" or "park")

**Call to action:**

The CTA is embedded in the reframe: "A risk register isn't a collection of everything that might go wrong. It's a prioritized queue of quantified threats with owners and deadlines."

This invites readers to audit their own registers. Implicit challenge: Is your register short and sharp, or long and ignored?

**Closing line:**

"Your register should be short, sharp, and fully resourced. Not long, vague, and ignored."

This lands perfectly. It's quotable, provocative, and actionable. Strong closer.

**Predicted engagement:** Very high. This will drive debate from:
- People who love the clarity ("Finally, someone said it")
- People who think "kill" is too aggressive ("But what about emerging risks?")
- People who want to know how you enforce the two-week rule

---

### Voice Alignment

**Evidence-first?** Yes. The piece leads with a concrete observation (bugs that can't be reproduced get closed in engineering, but not in risk management).

**Directly decisive?** Mostly. "Quantify or kill. Two weeks." is as decisive as it gets. But there's some softness in the "Quantify" paragraph where it meanders through questions. Tighten that.

**Quietly contrarian?** Yes. The piece challenges the default behavior (keeping vague risks open indefinitely) without screaming about it. The tone is "this is how it should work" not "you're all doing it wrong."

**Does it sound like Ian?** Yes. This sounds like an engineer who walked into a risk management org, saw the dysfunction, and applied engineering discipline. It's specific, structured, and contrarian. Not influencer-speak.

**The influencer test:** Read this in the voice of someone who posts "I'm humbled to announce..." Does it fit? No. The piece is too specific, too willing to say "close the ticket," too concrete.

### Top 3 Issues (Ranked by Impact)

1. **Style violations: 2 em-dashes (CRITICAL)** - Must be fixed before publishing. The em-dashes are on lines 23 and 33. Replace with periods or semicolons.

2. **"Quantify" paragraph sags (moderate)** - Paragraph 5 is too long and loses momentum. The three rhetorical questions ("How many systems... What's the actual exposure... Can you show three real examples?") feel repetitive. Tighten to 3-4 sentences. Suggested rewrite below.

3. **Unnecessary transition line (minor)** - "Here's how it works:" (line 21) can be deleted. Go straight from "Quantify or kill. Two weeks." to the definitions. The bold formatting makes it clear you're defining terms.

---

### Specific Rewrites

**Fix 1: Remove em-dashes**

**Current (line 23):**
> Not "this could be bad" — but specific data.

**Fixed:**
> Not "this could be bad." Specific data.

**Current (line 33):**
> The risks you're neglecting because your register is full of noise — those are the ones that will bite you.

**Fixed:**
> The risks you're neglecting because your register is full of noise? Those are the ones that will bite you.

---

**Fix 2: Tighten "Quantify" paragraph**

**Current (lines 23-25):**
> **Quantify:** Gather concrete evidence that makes the risk tangible. Not "this could be bad" — but specific data. How many systems are affected? What's the actual exposure? Can you show three real examples? If you can produce evidence, you now have an actionable risk with a measurable scope. Assign an owner, set acceptance criteria, allocate resources, track it like a production incident.

**Suggested rewrite:**
> **Quantify:** Gather concrete evidence that makes the risk tangible. Not "this could be bad." Specific data: How many systems are affected? What's the actual exposure? Can you show three real examples? If you can produce evidence, assign an owner, set acceptance criteria, and track it like a production incident.

(Reduced from 6 sentences to 4. Removed the explanatory middle sentence. Tightened the structure.)

---

**Fix 3: Remove unnecessary transition**

**Current (line 21):**
> Here's how it works:
>
> **Quantify:** [definition]

**Fixed:**
> **Quantify:** [definition]

(Just delete "Here's how it works:" and go straight to the definitions. The formatting makes it clear.)

## Final Assessment

This is a strong piece with a clear, actionable framework. The hook works, the structure is solid, and the closer lands hard. The "quantify or kill" concept is genuinely novel and immediately usable.

**Two critical fixes:**
1. Remove the 2 em-dashes (style violation)
2. Tighten the "Quantify" paragraph (momentum issue)

**One optional polish:**
- Delete "Here's how it works:" transition line

With these fixes, this is a **PUBLISH**-ready piece.

**Engagement prediction:** This will perform as well or better than Post #1. The framework is concrete, the pushback is named, and the closer is quotable. Expect debate in the comments.

**Score:** 8.5/10 (would be 9/10 with fixes)
