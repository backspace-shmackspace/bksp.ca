In software engineering, if a bug can't be reproduced, you close it. You don't carry an unreproducible bug on your backlog for two years "just in case."

Risk management should work the same way. But most risk registers run on gut feel. Tickets sit open for months with no evidence of impact, no quantified exposure, and no definition of what "mitigated" would even look like. Just vibes and a comment thread of people agreeing it's important.

Evidence-based risk management starts with a simple rule:

**Quantify or kill. Two weeks.**

**Quantify:** Produce concrete evidence. How many systems are affected? What's the actual exposure? Can you show three real examples? If you can, assign an owner, set acceptance criteria, and track it like a production incident.

**Kill:** If two weeks of focused evidence gathering yields nothing actionable, close the ticket. Not "defer." Not "move to monitoring." Close it. If there's no evidence, there's no risk. There's a feeling.

The obvious objection: "But what if we close it and something happens?"

Counter: What's happening RIGHT NOW while feelings-based tickets consume your meeting time? The risks with real evidence that you're neglecting because your register is full of noise?

A risk register is not a list of everything that might go wrong. It's a prioritized queue of evidenced threats with owners and deadlines.

Short, sharp, and fully resourced. Not long, vague, and ignored.

## Posting Notes

- Post 3-5 days after Post #1 to build momentum
- This one will generate disagreement from GRC/compliance professionals — that's engagement fuel
- No outbound link in main post
- First comment: "This pairs with my previous post on the Commitment-Without-Execution Loop — risks that can't be quantified are the ones most likely to cycle through that pattern indefinitely."

## Sensitivity Review

| Element | Source | Risk | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Two weeks" deadline | 1:1 with Vince re: PRODSECRM-105 | Generic enough — common sprint duration | Safe |
| "Over a year" | General observation | No specific ticket identifiable | Safe |
| "Three real examples" | PRODSECRM-105 evidence requirement | Anonymized to generic advice | Safe |
| "Obvious objection" framing | Anticipated counterargument | No false attribution | Safe |
| Bug reproduction analogy | Engineering background | Universal engineering concept | Safe |
| No people, companies, projects | — | — | Safe |

**No flags raised.** The "quantify or kill" framework is presented as a personal methodology. No specific risk, ticket, or organization is identifiable.
