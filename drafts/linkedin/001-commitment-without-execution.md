I spent 20 years in software engineering before moving into security risk management. The culture shock wasn't the threats. It was the risk register.

In engineering, a critical production bug that sits unresolved for months gets escalated, gets people reassigned, gets fixed. In risk management, I found critical-severity tickets that had been cycling through the same pattern for over a year — sometimes approaching two — with no sustained remediation.

Not because anyone was negligent. Because the system itself runs on a cycle I've started calling the Commitment-Without-Execution Loop:

1. **Awareness** — the risk is recognized and discussed
2. **Commitment** — specific actions and deadlines are agreed
3. **Partial action** — some work happens, usually manual, usually temporary
4. **Premature closure** — the risk is declared "mitigated" or moved to monitoring
5. **Stagnation** — the real fix stalls because something else is always more urgent
6. **Re-escalation** — the problem resurfaces. The cycle restarts.

The hardest part isn't spotting it. It's that every commitment in the cycle is made in good faith. No one is lying. But as an engineer, I learned a long time ago: a commitment without a resource allocation is just a sentence in a meeting.

Coming from engineering, my instinct was to apply the same standards I'd use for a critical bug:

- **Named owner** — not "the team will prioritize," but a specific person accountable
- **Acceptance criteria** — not "we'll look into it," but a definition of done
- **Sprint allocation** — not a prioritization discussion, but actual capacity committed
- **Regression testing** — not "mitigated," but verified that the fix held after the meeting ended

Open your risk register. Find your oldest critical-severity ticket. Count how many times it's been through this loop.

If the answer is more than twice, you don't have a risk management problem. You have an engineering management problem that nobody's treating like one.
