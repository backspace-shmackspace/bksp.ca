If nobody's working on it, it's not a commitment—it's theater.

In engineering, a critical production bug that sits unresolved for months gets escalated, gets people reassigned, gets fixed. In risk management, I found critical-severity tickets that had been cycling through the same pattern for over a year — sometimes approaching two — with no sustained remediation.

Not because anyone was negligent. Because the system itself runs on a cycle:

1. **Commitment** — the risk is discussed, actions are agreed, deadlines are set
2. **Partial action** — some work happens, usually manual, usually temporary
3. **Premature closure** — the risk is declared "mitigated" before the fix is verified
4. **Re-escalation** — the problem resurfaces. The cycle restarts.

No one is lying. No one is negligent. The system produces rational actors making reasonable promises that the system itself will never keep.

Coming from engineering, I thought the gap was discipline — that if you just applied real standards (owners, deadlines, verification), the cycle would break. I was wrong. The gap is comfort. A risk on a register feels managed. It has a status, an owner field, a target date. It looks like work is happening. Actually fixing it means making the failure visible and pulling people off other priorities. It means telling leadership the thing they signed off on six months ago never actually got done. The register doesn't just fail to solve the problem. It makes not solving it feel acceptable.

Open your risk register. Find your oldest critical-severity ticket. Count how many times it's been through this loop.

If the answer is more than twice, you don't have a risk management problem. You have an engineering management problem that nobody's treating like one.
