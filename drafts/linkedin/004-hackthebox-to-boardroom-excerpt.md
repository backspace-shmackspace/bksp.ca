I've rooted 94 machines on HackTheBox. Omniscient rank. Top 1,000 globally. Pro Labs simulating enterprise Active Directory networks with multi-stage attack chains.

Then I moved into risk management and found critical-severity tickets with no evidence, no quantified impact, and no owner. Some had been open for over a year.

In the HTB world, that's like running nmap, seeing port 80 open, typing "this could be bad" into your notes, and moving on to the next box.

The methodology I use to root a machine maps almost exactly to what's missing from most enterprise risk programs:

**Reconnaissance → Risk Discovery**
Build a picture of the attack surface before you touch anything. Most risk programs skip this and start with assumptions.

**Enumeration → Scope Definition**
Define the blast radius with specificity. Most risk tickets have a one-paragraph description that hasn't been updated since filing.

**Exploitation → Quantifying Impact**
Demonstrate, don't claim. The gap between "this could be bad" and "here's exactly how bad, with proof" is the gap between a risk register that drives decisions and one that collects dust.

**Privilege Escalation → Cascading Impact**
Pro Labs taught me to think in attack chains. Most risk programs evaluate each risk in isolation. Nobody maps the chain.

**Documentation → Risk Reporting**
If an HTB writeup read like a typical risk assessment, it would say: "The machine was vulnerable. Severity: High. Recommendation: Fix it." That writeup would get roasted in the community. But that's what passes for risk reporting in most enterprises.

If you're an engineer or ethical hacker moving into risk management, don't abandon your methodology at the door. It's the most valuable thing you're bringing with you.

## Posting Notes

- Post AFTER the blog is live on bksp.ca
- First comment: full URL to bksp.ca/defense/hackthebox-to-boardroom (keep link out of main post for reach)
- Second comment: "This is the fourth in a series. Previous posts: [#1 Commitment-Without-Execution Loop] [#2 Quantify or Kill] [#3 AI Red Team]" with links
- Consider posting on a Friday — HTB/security community is more active on weekends
- This post bridges the LinkedIn audience (risk managers) with the HTB/infosec audience (practitioners) — may pull in a new follower segment

## Sensitivity Review

| Element | Source | Risk | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| HTB stats | Public profile | Fully public | Safe |
| Pro Labs | Public profile | Fully public | Safe |
| "Over a year" aged tickets | Career-spanning | Not traceable | Safe |
| Methodology mapping | Original analysis | Ian's own framework | Safe |
| No employer, project, or people | — | — | Safe |

**No flags raised.**

## Content Strategy Notes

- Posts #1-3 are standalone LinkedIn posts (no blog required)
- **Post #4 is the first blog-promotion post** — requires bksp.ca to be live
- This establishes the pattern: standalone LinkedIn insights that occasionally drive traffic to longer blog pieces
- Sequence: #1 problem → #2 solution → #3 capability → #4 manifesto (blog launch)
