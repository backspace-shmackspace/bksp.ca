## Findings

### 🟢 Noted (acceptable as-is)

**"I've inherited risk registers where critical-severity tickets had been open for over a year..."**
- **Why it's OK:** "Inherited" frames this as career-spanning observation, not current-role reporting. No specific organization, timeframe, or ticket identifier.
- **Risk level:** Low. Could apply to any organization with a risk register.

**"The pushback I get from career risk managers..."**
- **Why it's OK:** "Career risk managers" is a role descriptor, not a reference to specific individuals. Frames pushback as a common industry objection, not a critique of colleagues.
- **Risk level:** None. Generic industry framing.

**"Two weeks" deadline**
- **Why it's OK:** Presented as a personal rule ("I brought a rule with me"), not a Red Hat policy or IBM policy. The methodology is attributed to Ian's engineering background, not his employer.
- **Risk level:** None. Personal methodology.

**"Quantify or kill" framework**
- **Why it's OK:** This is Ian's framework, not employer intellectual property. It's presented as a principle he applies, not a proprietary process belonging to Red Hat or IBM.
- **Risk level:** None. Personal methodology.

**No named entities found:**
- No people names
- No company names
- No product names
- No project identifiers (no JIRA keys, ticket numbers)
- No internal URLs or system names
- No team names or org structures

### Fingerprint Risk Assessment

**Can combinations of anonymized details identify the source?**

**No.**

The post describes:
1. A methodology ("Quantify or kill. Two weeks.")
2. A problem pattern (critical tickets open for over a year with no evidence)
3. A common objection from risk managers

None of these details, even in combination, point to a specific employer or project. The "two weeks" timeframe is presented as Ian's personal rule, not a Red Hat initiative.

**Could Ian's LinkedIn connections recognize this?**

Possibly—colleagues who work in risk management might recognize the pattern or the methodology if Ian has discussed it internally. But recognition of a methodology is different from identification of a specific employer project. The post doesn't say "at my current employer" or "in my current role." It's framed as "when I moved from engineering into risk" (career transition) and "I've inherited" (multiple organizations over time).

**Could this embarrass or harm Ian's employer?**

No. The post doesn't identify Red Hat, doesn't describe a specific Red Hat security gap, and doesn't attribute the bloated-register problem to any organization. It's a critique of risk management as a practice, not of any employer.

**Could this violate NDA or employment agreements?**

No. The post doesn't reveal proprietary methods, internal architecture, or specific incidents covered by confidentiality agreements. The "quantify or kill" framework is Ian's personal methodology, not employer IP.

## Recommendation

**Publish as-is.**

This post is well-anonymized and presents a personal methodology rather than an employer-specific critique. It's framed as a principle Ian brought from engineering to risk management, not as a Red Hat or IBM initiative. The tone is instructive (here's a better way), not accusatory (my employer is doing it wrong). No edits required.

## Notes for Ian

The draft includes a sensitivity review table (lines 48-59) that references specific internal tickets and conversations:
- "1:1 with Vince re: PRODSECRM-105"
- "PRODSECRM-105 evidence requirement"

**These internal references should NOT be published.** They're fine for your personal notes, but delete that table before posting. The LinkedIn post itself (lines 11-36) is clean and contains no identifiable references.

**Action:** Delete lines 39-66 (the entire "Posting Notes" and "Sensitivity Review" sections) before posting to LinkedIn. Those are draft metadata, not content.

---

## Final Check

**Published content (lines 11-36):** ✅ CLEAR
**Draft metadata (lines 39-66):** ⚠️ DELETE before posting (internal references)

**Overall verdict:** Safe to publish once draft metadata is removed.
