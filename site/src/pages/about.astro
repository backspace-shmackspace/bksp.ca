  <!-- Bio Section -->
  <section class="mb-16">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#f1f5f9] mb-6">About</h1>
    <div class="space-y-4">
      <p class="text-lg text-[#c8d1dc] leading-relaxed">
        I started with a music degree. Clarinet, saxophone, opera, composition — a Bachelor of Music in Performance from Mount Allison University. I still perform. Most recently I played Uncle Vanya with Next Folding Theatre Company. Music taught me something that turned out to be more useful than any technical certification: you cannot perform a piece until you understand the <em>intent</em> behind every phrase. It's not about playing the right notes in the right order. It's about understanding why the composer wrote them that way.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-[#c8d1dc] leading-relaxed">
        That same analytical instinct drove me through two decades in software — from CGI consulting, to BlackBerry R&D (where I shipped a patent), to leading the teams that built IBM's QRadar Cloud-Native SIEM and the watsonx-powered Investigation Assistant. It also drove me to the Top 10 on HackTheBox's global Hall of Fame. I didn't get there through exceptional talent — there are many hackers who are smarter and better than me. I got there through perseverance, hard work, and a rigorous method. When I hit a wall, I reach out to others — not for answers, but for guidance.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-[#c8d1dc] leading-relaxed">
        I learn by doing. I throw myself at things before I'm ready. During the pandemic I took up competitive chess, played thousands of games online, then entered my first over-the-board tournament. I lost four out of five matches — two of them to eight-year-olds. I signed up for the next one. That's how I approach everything: try, fail, adjust, repeat. Whether I'm learning a new piece of music, building an AI agent, or dissecting a security risk, the process is the same — break it into sections, analyze the patterns, experiment with interpretations, and get feedback.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-[#c8d1dc] leading-relaxed">
        Now I work in product security risk management. When I see a gap, I build something to fill it. When a risk lacks data, I write the scanner myself. When the process stalls, I dig in until I find the systemic cause — because problems are almost never one person's fault. They're cascading failures in a system, and fixing them requires understanding the system, not assigning blame.
      </p>
      <p class="text-[#94a3b8] leading-relaxed">
        I speak English and French natively, tech and exec fluently. I'm at ease in front of a 6-person meeting or a 1,000-seat auditorium. There's always a red-hot topic on my bench — right now it's multi-agent AI orchestration and the EU Cyber Resilience Act. Ask me next month and it'll be something else.
